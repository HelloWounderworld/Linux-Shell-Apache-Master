# Defnition about Regular Expression
A regular expression is a pattern template you define that a Linux utility uses to filter text. A Linux utility (such as the sed editor or the gawk program) matches the regular expression pattern against data as that data flows into the utility. If the data matches the pattern, it’s accepted for processing. If the data doesn’t match the pattern, it’s rejected.
