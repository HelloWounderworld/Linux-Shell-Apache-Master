# Working with Alternative Shells
This chapter discussed two popular alternative Linux shells that you may run into. The dash shell was developed as part of the Debian Linux distribution and is mainly found in the Ubuntu Linux distribution. It's a smaller version of the Bourne shell, so it doesn't support as many features as the bash shell, which can cause problems for script writing.

The zsh shell is often found in programming environments, because it provides lots of cool features for shell script programmers. It uses loadable modules to load separate code libraries, which make using advanced functions as easy as running command line commands! There are loadable modules for lots of different functions, from complex mathematical algorithms to network applications such as FTP and HTTP.

The next section of this book dives into some speciÔ¨Å c scripting applications you might run into in the Linux environment. The next chapter shows how to write simple utilities to help with your day-to-day Linux administration functions. Those can greatly help simplify common tasks you perform on the system.
