# Advanced Gawk
This chapter walked you through the more advanced features of the gawk programming language. Every programming language requires using variables, and gawk is no different. The gawk programming language includes some built-in variables that you can use to reference specific data field values and retrieve information about the number of data fields and records processed in the data file. You can also create your own variables for use in your scripts.

The gawk programming language also provides many of the standard structured commands you expect from a programming language. You can easily create fancy programs using if-then logic and while, do-while, and for loops. Each of these commands allows you to alter the flow of your gawk program script to iterate through data field values to create detailed data reports.

The printf command is a great tool to have if you need to customize your report output. It allows you to specify the exact format for displaying data from the gawk program script. You can easily create formatted reports, placing data elements in exactly the correct position.

Finally, this chapter discussed the many built-in functions available in the gawk programming language and showed you how to create your own functions. The gawk program contains many useful functions for handling mathematical features, such as standard square roots and logarithms, as well as trigonometric functions. There are also several string-related functions that make extracting substrings from larger strings a breeze.

You aren’t limited to the built-in functions in the gawk program. If you’re working on an application that uses lots of specialized algorithms, you can create your own functions to process the algorithms and use those functions in your own code. You can also set up a library file containing all the functions you use in your gawk programs, saving you time and effort in all your coding.

The next chapter switches gears a little. It examines a few other shell environments you may run into in your Linux shell-scripting endeavors. Although the bash shell is the most common shell used in Linux, it’s not the only shell. It helps to know a little about some of the other shells available and how they differ from the bash shell.
